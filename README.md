# rayshader_maps

This repository contains only a small selection of my graphic work for presentations to municipalities and other clients. The maps shown, obviously, do not refer to customer data, but are similar to those used in my work.
Rayshader is a very useful R package, not only for its beauty, but also for the ease with which we can present complex information using more appealing graphs.

I'll be using this package to add more graphics here over time.
