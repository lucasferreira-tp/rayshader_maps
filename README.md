# rayshader_maps

Rayshader is a very useful R package, not only for its beauty, but also for the ease with which we can present complex information using more appealing graphs.

I'll be using this package to add more graphics here over time.


**Data**

I got satellite data from Landsat 8 from INPE, the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (http://www.dgi.inpe.br/catalogo/). I used bands B4, B3, and B2, which are the red, blue, and green bands, respectively.

In turn, I obtained the topography data from NASA's EarthData (https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/).
